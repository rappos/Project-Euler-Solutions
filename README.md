### Warning

The code you're about to see could be harmful for the human eye. Most of it was coded when I still had to look up how to do a proper loop. Not really, but you get the idea. 

### Info

The code is done both in Java and in Python, and perhaps further down the line in some other language. Look into each problems folder to see which languages was used for each solution.
